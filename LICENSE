The disk image included in the distribution contains boot code which is
part of the ESDOS ][ disk format.  This is most likely copyrighted material
and therefore NOT in the public domain.  However, it is difficult to imagine
that its authors object to this code being redistributed for non-commercial
purposes, especially given its function.  ESDOS ][-formatted disk images
have been available for download on the Internet for years now with, it would
seem, no controversy at all.  (But don't go reverse-engineering it or trying
to sell it, as that's likely not what its authors had in mind.)
